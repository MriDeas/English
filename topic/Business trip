## 处理信息

#### 处理信息

> 在处理信息时，记住 'the three Cs'： clarifying、confirming 和 correcting（澄清、确认和纠正）

> 用此类表达来澄清和确认信息：

- A: **You mean**, the CEO isn't cooperating with us?
- B: Yes, **that's exactly what I mean**.


- A: **Let me make sure I've understood correctly**. They're not going to meet the deadline?
- B: Yes, **that's correct.**

- A: **So, what you're saying is**, we've got a big problem on our hands.
- B: That's right.

> 此类表达来纠正信息

- A: So, you want me to talk with them?
- B: **No. Actually**, I'm going to.

- A: So, we're looking for a new supplier?
- B: **No, that's incorrect. In fact**, we're still trying to work with our old one.


LIZ: After the **buyout**, we'll have a 25% market share.    
ROB: ++You mean++  , we're buying the company?  
LIZ: Yes, ++that's exactly  what I mean++. We're meeting with their CEO next week in New York.  
ROB: ++Let me make sure that I've understood correctly++  . We're buying the company, and you want me to go with you to a meeting next week?  
LIZ: Yes, ++that's correct++  . In New York.  
ROB: Wow. And we can talk about this? With staff, I mean.   
LIZ: ++No. Actually++  , I'd like to wait until the deal is certain.   

#### 强调和纠正

> 重读词语以强调和纠正  
当澄清、确认或纠正时，你可以重读某些词语，从而进行强调。 注意，yes 和 exactly 在此句子中重读：

- **Yes**, that's **exactly** what I mean.
- No. **Actually, you're** going tomorrow.

#### 消除疑虑

> 用此类表达来了解某人是否遇到问题：

- Is this a problem?
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- Are you OK with this?

> 用此类表达来消除某人的疑虑：

- No problem.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.
- It's going to be all right.
- I'm sure it's all just a misunderstanding(误解).

## 安排会议

#### 间接宾语  

> 英语中最常见的句子结构是主谓宾。

**主语** 　　	**谓语**	　　**宾语**  
Jack　　	sent　　	a postcard.

在此句子中，a postcard 是直接宾语，因为它是谓语动词动作的接受者（由杰克寄出）。
有时，名词或代词并不是动词动作的接受者，而是直接宾语的接受者。 这被称为间接宾语。

主语　	谓语　	间接宾语　	直接宾语  
Jack　	sent　	his wife　	a postcard.

his wife 是间接宾语，因为她是直接宾语的接受者 (a postcard)。注意，该间接宾语位于动词和直接宾语之间。


> 也可以使用介词 to 和 **for*，在直接宾语后接间接宾语。

主语　	谓语	　直接宾语　	间接宾语  
Jack　	sent	　a postcard	　to his wife.  
Jack　	bought　	a gift　　	for his wife.

以下是间接宾语的更多示例：

- I had to give **the hotel** my credit card number.	 我必须向酒店提供信用卡号码。
- I showed **the clerk** my passport.
- I showed my passport **to the clerk**.
- The hotel gave **my company** a discount.

> 当代词代替间接宾语时，我们称之为间接宾语代词。

- The hotel sent **me** a confirmation email. 
- The clerk gave **her** the bill(账单).
- The clerk gave the bill to **her**.

### 表达紧急和重要  

- It's absolutely critical(关键的;批评的) that we meet.
- It's vital(至关重要的) that we sit down together.
- It's essential(必要的;本质的) we get an understanding.
- We need to meet as soon as possible



> 用此类表达来表达紧急：

- **It's crucial** that we find a solution.
- **It's urgent** the company find a buyer.
- **It's essential** that he attend the meeting.
- **It's vital** no one discuss this information.
- **It's critical** that we meet the deadline.
- **It's imperative** all staff understand the situation.

> crucial .adj  关键, 紧要, 临界  
> urgent adj 紧急, 迫切, 急, 紧迫  
> essentical adj. 必要, 必不可少, 必需, 根本  
> vital  adj.重	要, 有活力  
> critical adj. 临界, 严重, 批评, 危急, 紧要  
> imperative  adj.	迫切, 急迫, 急切



这些非常正式的表达通常后接动词原形。注意在这些例子中，并未遵循主谓一致原则：动词 attend 和 report 结尾并未后接 s。在此种强烈或情感的动词之后，第二个动词采用称为虚拟式的特殊形式。

- It's essential that he **attend** the meeting.他必须出席会议。
- It's vital she **report** to us immediately.

>用副词 absolutely 来加强紧迫感

- It's absolutely critical that we meet the deadline.
- It's absolutely crucial we find a solution.

语言注释： 谨慎使用 absolutely、completely 和 totally 等修饰语；如果情况并非如你的用语那样紧急，你可能被责怪夸大事实。



Thank you all for coming today. First, let me say that it is absolutely **essential**  that nothing I discuss here today go outside this room. That said, I think you all understand how **urgent**  it is that we find a solution to the problem of our decreasing market share. It's **imperative**  that we increase sales in the fastest-growing region for our products – Asia. Because of this, we have decided to purchase our biggest competitor. It's **vital**  that this deal be successful. We have the financial strength, and it's **crucial**  that we take advantage of this opportunity.
